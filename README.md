# Amiram Timer

## Overview:
As one of my first projects in 2022, I created this timer app to enhance my study sessions for the Amiram exams.<br>
These exams are divided into three parts, each requiring a specific amount of time.<br> Understanding the importance of efficient time management, I developed this app to simplify the process of setting up timers for each part, eliminating the hassle of manual adjustments.

## Key Features:
**Flexible Display:** The app is designed to adapt to both portrait and landscape modes, offering a comfortable viewing experience in any orientation.<br><br>
**Persistent Screen:** The screen remains active throughout the study session, preventing any unintended disruptions.<br><br>
**Timely Notifications:** When the time for each part comes to an end, the app emits a small buzzer sound accompanied by a ringing tone, ensuring you are promptly alerted.<br>

<br>
With this timer app, you can optimize your study sessions for the Amiram exams, allowing you to concentrate on the content without the added stress of manual timer adjustments between different parts.
